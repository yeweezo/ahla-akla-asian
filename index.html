Place hot dog in steamed bun. Pile on toppings in this order: mustard, relish, onion, tomato, pickle, peppers, and celery salt. The tomato wedges should be nestled between hot dog and top of bun on one side. Place pickle between hot dog and bottom of bun on the other side. Don't even think about ketchup!

        Buffalo Wings
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Ingredients
    </h3>
    <h3>
        6 chicken drums,
2 cups pickle juice,
2 cups buttermilk,
1 stick butter,
2 cups ketchup,
1/4 cup brown sugar,
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar,
Squeeze lemon juice,
2 tbsp honey,
1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce,
Pinch smoked paprika,
Hickory smoke (optional),
2 cups potato starch,
1 tsp garlic powder,
1 tsp onion powder,
1 tsp old bay,
1 tsp lemon pepper,
1 tsp truffle salt
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Combine butter, ketchup, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, lemon, honey, Worcestershire, paprika, and optional puff of hickory smoke into pan over medium heat and whisk until well combined.
Boil this mixture off until it reaches the correct consistency, then set aside.
Add the drums to a bowl and cover in buttermilk and pickle juice. Allow this to brine 30 minutes.
Add potato starch, garlic powder, onion powder, old bay, lemon pepper and truffle salt to a large bowl.
Dredge your chicken wings in the starch mixture and tap off excess.
Add to the frying oil at 325 Fahrenheit for about 6 minutes until just about fully cooked. (NOTE: I said 375 to start the video, which is incorrect.)
Set these aside and heat oil to 375 F, then fry again until golden brown and crispy.
